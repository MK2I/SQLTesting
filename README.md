Structured Query Language (SQL) is a common tool for retrieving data from relational databases such as SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL. This course provides an introduction to this core programming language. Learn how to request data from a database, limit and sort the responses, aggregate data from multiple tables with joins, and edit and delete data. Instructor Scott Simpson also shows how to perform simple math operations and transform data into different formats.

## Learning objectives
- Name the predicate of the following statement: SELECT EyeColor, Age FROM Student WHERE FirstName = 'Tim' ORDER BY LastName ASC;
- Explain what to use to enforce the order in which an expression must be evaluated if the WHERE clause contains multiple expressions to evaluate.
- Identify the best option to join two tables in a database to be able to display data from both.
- List a data type that is not numeric.
- Determine the result of running the following statement on a table containing columns col_1 and col_2:
- INSERT INTO Box (col_1, col_2) VALUES ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'B');
- Determine the best approach of deleting Jon Ramirez (ID 3452) from a Student table.
